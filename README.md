# 👋 Hello there

It's me, Jarek 😆

Here are some bullet points about me.

- *Software Engineer*: I began exploring software in 1997. Fast forward a couple of decades, and I have extensive experience building various complex software systems. These range from search engines and web applications to electronic trading systems, low-latency processing platforms, and massive distributed data processing systems. Today, I run my own software consulting firm, [Input Objects](https://inputobjects.eu?ref=github-jrozanski-profile).
- *Student of Applied Business Management*: Running a business as a software engineer means I am learning business management on the fly. Taxes aside, managing a business is a fascinating and very challenging endeavor that keeps me sharp.
- *Functional Programmer*: I code in Scala daily and have a keen interest in OCaml and F#.
- *Result-Oriented Generalist*: While I have a preference for functional programming, I frequently work with Java, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Go.
- *Privacy Aficionado*: I turned my passion for online privacy into a product, [Wide Angle Analytics](https://wideangle.co?ref=github-jrozanski-profile). Check it out; it is a fairly priced, privacy-first, cookieless web analytics tool.
- *Electronics Geek*: With a formal education in electronics, computer engineering, and FPGA, there isn’t a day that goes by without me reading about interesting electronics, custom keyboards, and projects involving single-board computers like Raspberry Pi.


A tag cloud that would encompass my interests goes something like this (no particular order):

Scala, Java, software, web analytics, Elasticsearch, Solr, real-time analytics, Apache Pinot, Doris, Kafka, Kubernetes, Ansible, C#, F#, Go Lang, JavaScript, TypeScript, functional programming, entrepreneur, privacy.
